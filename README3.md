Overview

This project aims to mimic youtube's playlist. It will allow you to log in and generate playlists based on youtube videos you choose to add to playlists. 

You can either create a new playlist, delete from a playlist or browse for videos that you wish to add to a playlist. We allow login and sign ups accordingly for user authentication and to remember playlists.
